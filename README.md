BMI Calculation and Calculation No of Persons Overweight

The following project explains where we calcualted BMI using mathematical formulae :
BMI=Weight(kg)/Height(m)^2

First uploaded the json file converted into csv file.
Then created a column for BMI and the values are imputed based on mathematical formulae provided.
Next Cretaed a weight category where based on BMI we created the weight category named as Normal weight, Under weight etc.
Declared a value variable where we imputed any weight category name
Then used a for loop to count ho many persons are having the weight category variable name
